# CSC 1019 Lecture Code

This is for my lectures and class sessions for introduction to python


The repo is split by 'topics'. There are 7 in total in the course, but only 4 - 7 involve coding in python. You will find a folder for each repo which contains examples for covering in class and a 'Solutions' folder with examples of how to solve the in-class 'Challenge' problems.
